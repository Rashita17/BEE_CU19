Exp. 1 Design an LED Flasher

Program:-
void setup()
{
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
  delay(1000); 
  digitalWrite(12, LOW);
  delay(5000);
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(1000); 
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(2500);
}
Algorithm:-
Step1:-Take a breadboard and make a circuit .
Step2:-After completion of circuit attach arduino to computer  for programming.
Step3:-Run the program.
Step4:-your program is succcessfully uploaded
